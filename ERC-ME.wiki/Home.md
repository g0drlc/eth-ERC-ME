# Welcome to the ERC-ME wiki!

This is the community-maintained wiki and documentation covering all sorts of information on the **ERC-ME** platform, _a smart contract infrastructure for managing profiles and identities on the blockchain_ proposed by Ghilia Weldesselasie. **ERC-ME** hopes to power a standard upon which Dapps can build new social networks and games centered around users without holding user information. A future in which apps are sorely focused on the UX of their apps and crafting the best experience and where users can switch to any apps they like while sill maintaining their following and profile info.

ERC-ME is a [ERC-721](https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/721) token contract that represents you and your identity. ERC-ME is a digital badge or a personal cryptocurrency/token that represents you and can be used in various Dapps or other contracts on the blockchain.

Contribute to the wiki by submitting an [issue](https://github.com/ghiliweld/ERC-ME/issues) (don't forget to add the wiki label).
