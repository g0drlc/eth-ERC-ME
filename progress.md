- Wrote initial proposal(README.md) for ERC-ME

**12/01/2018**
- Started working on ERC-ME smart contracts.
- The contracts are separated in three: ERC721.sol, MyNonFungibleToken.sol and ERCME.sol.
- The first two are copied from [this repository](https://github.com/m0t0k1ch1/ERC721-token-sample), I'll be auditing them later.
- The last one (ERCME.sol) contains my own custom implementation needed for the ERC-ME platform.

**13/01/2018**
- Completed the three contracts to the best of my ability.
- Will be awaiting more feature ideas I could implement, otherwise my work is done and all that's left is auditing.
